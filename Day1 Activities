#Display a list of Windows Firewall Rules.
get-netfirewallrule

#Create a new alias called "gh" for the cmdlet "Get-Help"
set-alias gh get-help





# ACTIVITY 3

# Create a variable called "var1" that holds a random number between 25-50.

$var1 = Get-Random -Minimum 25 -Maximum 50
# Create a variable called "var2" that holds a random number between 1-10.

$var2 = Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 10
# Create a variable called "sum" that holds the sum of var1 and var2.

$sum = $var1 + $var2
# Create a variable called "sub" that holds the difference of var1 and var2.

$sub = $var1 - $var2
# Create a variable called "prod" that holds the product of var1 and var2.

$prod = $var1 * $var2
# Create a variable called "quo" that holds the quotient of var1 and var2.

$quo = $var1 / $var2
# Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:


write-host "$var1" + "$var2" = "$sum"


# Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:


write-host "$var1" - "$var2" = "$sub"


# Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:


write-host "$var1" * "$var2" = "$prod"


# Replace the variables in text with their values in the following format:


write-host "$var1" / "$var2" = "$quo"



# ACTIVITY 4

# Create an array containing a range with a random starting and stopping point.  The starting point will be a random number from -10 through 0.
# The ending point will be a random number from 1 through 20.

$var1 = Get-Random -Minimum -10 -Maximum 0
$var2 = Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 20

$arr = $var1..$var2

# Create a variable that contains the contents of the array in reverse
$arr2 = $arr[-1]..$arr[0]
