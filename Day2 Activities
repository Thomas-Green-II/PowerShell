# ACTIVITY 5
Create two empty hash tables with the following names:

$employee1 = @{}
$employee2 = @{}


# Using the following table of key-value pairs, apply each key-value to the empty hash tables.
$employee1.Add("First","Mary")
$employee1.Add("Last","Hopper")
$employee1.Add("ID","001")
$employee1.Add( "JOB","Software Developer")


$employee2.Add("First","John")
$employee2.Add("Last","Williams")
$employee2.Add("ID","002")
$employee2.Add("Job","Web Developer")

# Now add a new key called Username which holds a contraction of the employee’s first initial then last name then ID. (i.e. mhopper001).
$employee1.Add("Username","mhopper001")
$employee2.Add("Username","jwilliams002")

# Mary got promoted to "Software Lead" so the job key for Mary needs to be changed to "Software Lead"
$employee1["Job"] = "Software Lead"

# Create a new hash table called "employee3" that contains the following values with the respective keys.
$employee3 = @{}
$employee3.Add("First","Alex")
$employee3.Add("Last","Moran")
$employee3.Add("ID","003")
$employee3.Add("Job","Software Developer")

# Add a new key called "Status" that holds the values:
$employee1.Add("Status","Management")
$employee2.Add("Status","Intermediate")
$employee3.Add("Status","Entry Level")




# ACTIVITY 2

# Display the start time of the earliest and latest running processes
get-process | where-object processname -ne "Idle" | sort -property starttime | select-object -first 1 -last 1 | format-table name,starttime

# Identify a cmdlet that returns the current date and time then using this cmdlet and Select-object, display only the current day of the week
Get-Date | select-object -Property Dayofweek
# or
(get-date).DayofWeek

# Identify a cmdlet that displays a list of installed hotfixes.
get-hotfix

# Extend the expression to sort the list by install date, and display only the install date and hotfix ID.
Get-hotfix | sort -property installedon | select-object -property installedon,hotfixid

# Extend the expression further, but this time sort by description, include description, hotfix ID, and install Date.
Get-hotfix | sort -property description | select-object -property description,installedon,hotfixid
