# ACTIVITY 5
Create two empty hash tables with the following names:

$employee1 = @{}
$employee2 = @{}


# Using the following table of key-value pairs, apply each key-value to the empty hash tables.
$employee1.Add("First","Mary")
$employee1.Add("Last","Hopper")
$employee1.Add("ID","001")
$employee1.Add( "JOB","Software Developer")


$employee2.Add("First","John")
$employee2.Add("Last","Williams")
$employee2.Add("ID","002")
$employee2.Add("Job","Web Developer")

# Now add a new key called Username which holds a contraction of the employeeâ€™s first initial then last name then ID. (i.e. mhopper001).
$employee1.Add("Username","mhopper001")
$employee2.Add("Username","jwilliams002")

# Mary got promoted to "Software Lead" so the job key for Mary needs to be changed to "Software Lead"
$employee1["Job"] = "Software Lead"

# Create a new hash table called "employee3" that contains the following values with the respective keys.
$employee3 = @{}
$employee3.Add("First","Alex")
$employee3.Add("Last","Moran")
$employee3.Add("ID","003")
$employee3.Add("Job","Software Developer")

# Add a new key called "Status" that holds the values:
$employee1.Add("Status","Management")
$employee2.Add("Status","Intermediate")
$employee3.Add("Status","Entry Level")




# ACTIVITY 6

# Display the start time of the earliest and latest running processes
get-process | where-object processname -ne "Idle" | sort -property starttime | select-object -first 1 -last 1 | format-table name,starttime

# Identify a cmdlet that returns the current date and time then using this cmdlet and Select-object, display only the current day of the week
Get-Date | select-object -Property Dayofweek
# or
(get-date).DayofWeek

# Identify a cmdlet that displays a list of installed hotfixes.
get-hotfix

# Extend the expression to sort the list by install date, and display only the install date and hotfix ID.
Get-hotfix | sort -property installedon | select-object -property installedon,hotfixid

# Extend the expression further, but this time sort by description, include description, hotfix ID, and install Date.
Get-hotfix | sort -property description | select-object -property description,installedon,hotfixid


# ACTIVITY 7

# ACTIVITY 9
Part 1

Use an array to iterate and open the following


Notepad
MS Edge
MSpaint


Query the processes

Kill the processes from PowerShell

$arr = 'notepad','msedge','mspaint'

foreach ($i in $arr)
{
start-process $i
(get-process $i).kill()
}




Part 2
Use an array to iterate and open the following

Notepad
MS Edge
MSpaint

$arr = 'notepad','msedge','mspaint'

Query the processes
foreach ($i in $arr)
{
start-process $i
get-process $i
}

Save the ProcessIDs to a text file called procs.txt
$file = "$pwd\procs.txt"

foreach($proc in $arr){
    get-process | where-object{$_.Name -like $proc} | Foreach-object{add-content $file $_.Id} }

Iterate through the ProcessIDs in the text file and kill them
get-content .\procs.txt | foreach-object{stop-process -id $_}




Part 3

Use an array to iterate and open the following
$arr = 'notepad','msedge','mspaint'

Notepad
MS Edge
MSpaint

Query the processes and display only the following information in order by process ID


Process ID
foreach($proc in $arr){
    get-process | where-object{$_.Name -like $proc} | Format-Table -property id, name, starttime, totalprocessortime, VirtualMemorySize,
    WorkingSet64 }
    
Process Name
The time the process started
The amount of time the process has spent on the processor
The amount of memory assigned to the process
